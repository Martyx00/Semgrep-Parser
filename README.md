# Semgrep Parser README

The Semgrep Parser allows tracking the results of the Semgrep scans with JSON results in the VS Code. It allows simple categorization of issues as False Positives or as real Issues and Save/Load progress.

It has two actions:
* `Semgrep Triage: Open Results File` opens the Semgrep JSON file.
* `Semgrep Triage: Open Empty View` opens an empty view so that you can load previous progress.
